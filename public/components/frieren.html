            <p>Iâ€™m a big fan of the anime Frieren: Beyond Journey's End, 
              and my appreciation for it extends beyond watching the show. 
              While in Osaka, I purchased my Frieren plushie, 
              and I also had the opportunity to visit a 
              Frieren-themed exhibition.

            <p>In the future I would like to create a Frieren fan game. I have built a Friern tower
              defense game using Godot however I didn't get enough time to build it out and polish it. 
              Currently thinking about a dungeon rouge like game since Frieren likes to clear dungeons.
